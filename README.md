# CSGO_Scoreboard_Wallhack
 Small CS:GO Wallhack - Moving your cursor to enemy's location when Scoreboard is opened

### Original description
It's not a great wallhack but it can be useful when playing on LANs or whatever to take a quick look, as it can be a bit hard for other people to detect. Basically what it does is when you open the scoreboard with TAB it will search for the closest enemy, get his coordinates, and move your cursor close to him
